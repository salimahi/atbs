# ATBS = Automate the Boring Stuff (on Python)
The files in this repository are projects I completed while working through the Automate The Boring Stuff Udemy course. Read below for the descriptions of each project. 

## roulette-strategy.py
This was one of my first projects in the course. I decided to practice creating if and while statements
by testing out a roulette strategy. 
The intent is to double the amount of cash in hand. 
The strategy is to continously bet on Black but increase the bet by $5 every time. 
The code accounts for you not having enough money to bet with. 
Once you run it, you will see:
-Your last bet
-The last wheel result
-Your total cash
-How many zeros, reds or blacks you hit.
-The expected value of your betting length. 

## nftf-habit-determination-algorithm.py
This program is for someone who is trying to decide if they want to take on a new habit while operationalizing the Negative Five to Five Scale (NFTF).
(You can read about the NFTF Scale on my blog at: https://www.salimahismail.com/read/nftf)

When you run the program, you will be prompted to share the habit you are thinking about taking on 
and then it will ask you a series of questions with active feedback on whether or not it is the right decision.
