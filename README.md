# Repository Description
The files in this repository are projects I completed while working through the Automate The Boring Stuff Udemy course. Read below for the descriptions of each project. 

## roulette-strategy.py
This was one of my first projects in the course. I decided to practice creating if and while statements
by testing out a roulette strategy. 
The intent is to double the amount of cash in hand. 
The strategy is to continously bet on Black but increase the bet by $5 every time. 
The code accounts for you not having enough money to bet with. 
Once you run it, you will see:
-Your last bet
-The last wheel result
-Your total cash
-How many zeros, reds or blacks you hit.
